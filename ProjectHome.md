# bibScripter #

bibScripter is a **framework** for quickly whipping out python scripts for various tasks involving bibTeX files.
Key features include
  * **minimal diff modifications**: Any change you make to the parsed data structure will have minimal impact on the bib-file.
  * **zero-install**: no dependencies outside the standard library are accepted. `bibScripter.py` will remain a single file.
